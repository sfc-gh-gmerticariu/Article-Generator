Even though NFL Game Pass Pro is available worldwide, you won‚Äôt be able to live stream any regular-season or post-season games with a US Game Pass ‚Äî you‚Äôll only be able to watch on-demand replays after the game. This is because regular-season games are licensed to networks like CBS, FOX, NBC, ESPN, and Amazon Prime Video. You‚Äôll need subscriptions to multiple streaming platforms to catch every game, which adds up to hundreds of dollars per season.
However, outside the US, UK, Canada, and Ireland, you can buy an international NFL Game Pass Pro with no restrictions. When you buy a Game Pass in countries like Brazil, India, Japan, Germany, and South Africa, you‚Äôll have access to all pre-season, regular-season, and post-season NFL games live! You‚Äôll also have access to extras like NFL RedZone and an entire library of on-demand NFL films and series.
With the help of a VPN, you can spoof your location by connecting to a server in another country. When you connect to a server outside the US, you‚Äôll be able to sign up for an NFL Game Pass Pro INTL and access every game live, including playoffs and the Super Bowl.

As a tech journalist, I'm often asked why someone would need a VPN to watch out-of-market NFL games. The answer is simple: the NFL has different licensing agreements in different countries, so if you want to stream live regular season and post-season games outside of the US, UK, Canada or Ireland, you'll need an international Game Pass Pro. 

The great thing about this pass is that it gives you access to all pre-season, regular season and post-season NFL games live! You also get extras like NFL RedZone and an entire library of on-demand films and series. But here's the catch - these passes are only available in certain countries. 

That's where a VPN comes in handy! With a VPN service provider like ExpressVPN or NordVPN ,you can easily spoof your location by connecting to a server in another country where an international Game Pass Pro is available. This way you can sign up for the pass without having to physically be there ‚Äî giving you access to every game live including playoffs and even the Super Bowl!
